' This is the multi-platform build, forked from the original pseudo-Windows
' build of CK Tech Demo version 0.1.3, after I moved the source code over to
' QB64 from QuickBASIC (PDS) 7.1, and re-instated Aaron Severn's side-
' scrolling engine, and DarkDread's fade-in/out code. I did make a few tweaks,
' though, mainly borrowing bits and pieces of code from the engine I was
' originally going to build for the DOS version (and still might, if I decide
' to pick that project back up). But this one definitely runs without DOS,
' and should hopefully run in OSes other than Linux (like Windows XP, Vista,
' 7, 8 and Mac OS X) without too much trouble.
'
' Thanks to QB64, I can essentially port the code to C++ if I do it right,
' but it's now multi-platform (like I said above), so the only problem I
' would have, is compiling Cricket under any version of Mac OS X. Now, if
' someone would like to do that, so that Cricket can be ported to Mac OS,
' then by all means, feel free. This is open-source, after all.
'
' TODO: Speed up Cricket, implement "jumping", and maybe more of the level
'       layout of SMB1 World 1-1 for testing purposes? Now let's code some
'       levels, like Generitica 1, for example!
' #2    Let's design some clouds, a sun, and some shadowed buildings for the
'       background layer, then either add more to the level, or think about
'       how we're going to implement the sprite plane, or object layer. I
'       actually thought having two tile planes was gonna slow things down,
'       but surprisingly, it practically didn't miss a beat. How about three?
' #3    The idea worked! Hopefully it does what I hope it does, and reads up
'       to five sets of 22 lines (110 total), so either I, or future modders,
'       can put in some pretty long levels. I'm debating on whether or not to
'       actually put in more than one level for the tech demo (like world 1-1
'       through 1-4), to show the engine reading more than one pair of files.
'       But I should finish 1-1 and consider working on the sprite layer. I'm
'       also hoping to find a way to speed up the sprite rendering engine.
' #4    I'm actually pretty close to finishing world 1-1. I just need to make
'       the rest of the level complete "house", and extend the map by just a
'       few more columns of sprites, so I can finish everything else out. I
'       was thinking about having a door on the far right that opens, after
'       Cricket triggers the end-of-level slot machine, which he will then
'       walk out of, afterward. I'm also tempted to put random things in the
'       level complete "house", like a family watching TV, a married couple
'       sleeping in their bed, and stuff like that, just for kicks. They
'       wouldn't be surprised; they'd just watch Cricket trigger the slot
'       machine, then walk out. I should also move the level loading commands
'       to the "starting level" display, like how they'll be in the full game,
'       and move the "engine tech demo information" screen to either before
'       hardware detection or the FlameWare logo, or on the game logo screen.
' #5 >> Once I finish with TODO #4, I'm also gonna need to extend the length
'       of maps that the map reader will be capable of using, because I don't
'       think any of the maps I'm gonna create for the actual game will fit
'       in two sets of 600 or so by 22 rows of sprites (for example, only
'       three-fourths of SMB1 world 1-1 fits in one set). I'm thinking I might
'       have to do either four sets, or five, at least. Theoretically, either
'       of those (and 5, preferably) will give me enough space to make some
'       pretty long game maps.
'
' LIST OF GAME FIXES I'VE DONE SO FAR (FOR REFERENCE):
' 0.1.0 Ran out of space and memory using DATA and READ statements, and would
'       even get a "Module level code too large" message.
' FIX:  Moved the hardware detection screen, FlameWare logo drawing commands
'       and the Cricket Kamodon logo (and probably menu, soon) into SUBs, and
'       moved the DATA commands into two files (WLDXL1BG.KMD for background,
'       and WLDXL1FG.KMD for foreground; I'll follow the same method for the
'       actual game (WLDAL1FG.KMD, WLDBL4FG.KMD, etc.)
' 0.1.1 Background and foreground data file reader would get stuck at the end
'       of the first 22 lines in the data files (after 1024 characters), and
'       would start redrawing the level from the beginning, one row of sprites
'       higher, about 3/4ths into the level.
' FIX:  Reprogram the reader to grab every single line from the data files,
'       one after the other, and combine each line (1st and 23rd, 2nd and
'       24th, etc.), before reading each set of numbers between the commas,
'       and filling the foreground and background data arrays. This also makes
'       level design a bit more modder-friendly, since this game will be open-
'       source, after all. The current code supports 110 rows of sprites.
' 0.1.3 Iminent problem of not having enough room to put the actual engine
'       code into the main module, because of the DATA statements toward the
'       end that draw each sprite.
' FIX:  Will soon have to add another subroutine for the sprite reader, which
'       will theoretically let anyone add a lot more sprites, and give each
'       sprite up to 16 different frames of animation, through files
'       WLD?L?S0.KMD to WLD?L?SF.KMD. I figure this can make for some
'       incredibly realistic animation, if done right. This will move the
'       DATA statements that put the sprites into memory out of the source
'       code, and make room for the actual engine code.
' 0.1.4 Problem was averted with code conversion to QB64. This gets rid of
'       QuickBASIC's old "module level code too large" error, because now I
'       can put as much code in the main module as I want to, and I can even
'       use new commands, and background music/sound effects without having
'       to use a library. The only problem is, I feel like I'm quickly running
'       out of sprites I can use on one background plane.
' FIX:  Increased the maximum number of different possible sprites one can use
'       per sprite plane to 1,000, from 100. If this isn't enough for any
'       potential modders, the level data files can be switched to hexadecimal
'       format instead, theoretically allowing up to 65,536 different possible
'       sprites anyone can use on a map (no matter which sprite plane they're
'       put onto). Also added a second background plane, so I can work on
'       adding parallax scrolling.
