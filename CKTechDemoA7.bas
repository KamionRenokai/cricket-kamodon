' This is the multi-platform build, forked from the original pseudo-Windows
' build of CK Tech Demo version 0.1.3, after I moved the source code over to
' QB64 from QuickBASIC (PDS) 7.1, and re-instated Aaron Severn's side-
' scrolling engine, and DarkDread's fade-in/out code. I did make a few tweaks,
' though, mainly borrowing bits and pieces of code from the engine I was
' originally going to build for the DOS version (and still might, if I decide
' to pick that project back up). But this one definitely runs without DOS,
' and should hopefully run in OSes other than Linux (like Windows XP, Vista,
' 7, 8 and Mac OS X) without too much trouble.
'
' Thanks to QB64, I can essentially port the code to C++ if I do it right,
' but it's now multi-platform (like I said above), so the only problem I
' would have, is compiling Cricket under any version of Mac OS X. Now, if
' someone would like to do that, so that Cricket can be ported to Mac OS,
' then by all means, feel free. This is open-source, after all.
'
' TODO: Speed up Cricket, implement "jumping", and maybe more of the level
'       layout of SMB1 World 1-1 for testing purposes? Now let's code some
'       levels, like Generitica 1, for example!
' #2    Let's design some clouds, a sun, and some shadowed buildings for the
'       background layer, then either add more to the level, or think about
'       how we're going to implement the sprite plane, or object layer. I
'       actually thought having two tile planes was gonna slow things down,
'       but surprisingly, it practically didn't miss a beat. How about three?
' #3    The idea worked! Hopefully it does what I hope it does, and reads up
'       to five sets of 22 lines (110 total), so either I, or future modders,
'       can put in some pretty long levels. I'm debating on whether or not to
'       actually put in more than one level for the tech demo (like world 1-1
'       through 1-4), to show the engine reading more than one pair of files.
'       But I should finish 1-1 and consider working on the sprite layer. I'm
'       also hoping to find a way to speed up the sprite rendering engine.
' #4    I'm actually pretty close to finishing world 1-1. I just need to make
'       the rest of the level complete "house", and extend the map by just a
'       few more columns of sprites, so I can finish everything else out. I
'       was thinking about having a door on the far right that opens, after
'       Cricket triggers the end-of-level slot machine, which he will then
'       walk out of, afterward. I'm also tempted to put random things in the
'       level complete "house", like a family watching TV, a married couple
'       sleeping in their bed, and stuff like that, just for kicks. They
'       wouldn't be surprised; they'd just watch Cricket trigger the slot
'       machine, then walk out. I should also move the level loading commands
'       to the "starting level" display, like how they'll be in the full game,
'       and move the "engine tech demo information" screen to either before
'       hardware detection or the FlameWare logo, or on the game logo screen.
' #5 >> Once I finish with TODO #4, I'm also gonna need to extend the length
'       of maps that the map reader will be capable of using, because I don't
'       think any of the maps I'm gonna create for the actual game will fit
'       in two sets of 600 or so by 22 rows of sprites (for example, only
'       three-fourths of SMB1 world 1-1 fits in one set). I'm thinking I might
'       have to do either four sets, or five, at least. Theoretically, either
'       of those (and 5, preferably) will give me enough space to make some
'       pretty long game maps.
'
' LIST OF GAME FIXES I'VE DONE SO FAR (FOR REFERENCE):
' alpha 0:  Ran out of space and memory using DATA and READ statements, and
'           would even get a "Module level code too large" message.
'     FIX:  Moved the hardware detection screen, FlameWare logo drawing
'           commands and the Cricket Kamodon logo (and probably menu, soon)
'           into SUBs, and moved the DATA commands into two files
'           (WLDXL1BG.KMD for background, and WLDXL1FG.KMD for foreground;
'           I'll follow the same method for the actual game (WLDAL1FG.KMD,
'           WLDBL4FG.KMD, etc.)
' alpha 1:  Background and foreground data file reader would get stuck at the
'           end of the first 22 lines in the data files (after 1024
'           characters), and would start redrawing the level from the
'           beginning, one row of sprites higher, about 3/4ths into the level.
'     FIX:  Reprogrammed the reader to grab every single line from the data
'           files, one after the other, and combine each line (1st and 23rd,
'           2nd and 24th, etc.), before reading each set of numbers between
'           the commas, and filling the foreground and background data arrays.
'           This also makes level design a bit more modder-friendly, since
'           this game will be open-source, after all. The current code
'           supports 110 rows of sprites.
' alpha 3:  Iminent problem of not having enough room to put the actual engine
'           code into the main module, because of the DATA statements toward
'           the end that draw each sprite.
'     FIX:  Will soon have to add another subroutine for the sprite reader,
'           which will theoretically let anyone add a lot more sprites, and
'           give each sprite up to 16 different frames of animation, through
'           files WLD?L?S0.KMD to WLD?L?SF.KMD. I figure this can make for
'           some incredibly realistic animation, if done right. This will move
'           the DATA statements that put the sprites into memory out of the
'           source code, and make room for the actual engine code.
' alpha 4:  Problem was averted with code conversion to QB64. This gets rid of
'           QuickBASIC's old "module level code too large" error, because now
'           I can put as much code in the main module as I want to, and I can
'           even use new commands, and background music/sound effects without
'           having to use a library. The only problem is, I feel like I'm
'           quickly running out of sprites I can use on one background plane.
'     FIX:  Increased the maximum number of different possible sprites one can
'           use per sprite plane to 1,000, from 100. If this isn't enough for
'           any potential modders, the level data files can be switched to
'           hexadecimal format instead, theoretically allowing up to 65,536
'           different possible sprites anyone can use on a map (no matter
'           which sprite plane they're put onto). I also added a second
'           background plane, so I can work on adding parallax scrolling.
' alpha 6:  Going to add in vertical scrolling, but I have to figure out a way
'           to implement it properly. The pixel drawing routine can't really
'           handle vertical and horizontal scrolling in its current state.
'     FIX:  Upgraded the drawing routine to be able to store multiple screens
'           (more than 22 rows), and made the background/foreground resource
'           files bigger, to accommodate this.
' alpha 7:  Having three sprite layers (BG1, BG2 and FG1) might make it hard
'           to do parallax scrolling in the future, especially since I'm using
'           BG1 for some of the background effects in Subcon 1.
