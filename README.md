===============

Cricket Kamodon is a work-in-progress side-scrolling platform game starring an anthropomorphic cricket, programmed in QB64. As of January 5th, 2014, there is no stable build of this game yet. This is primarily used as a web backup, and for me to learn how to use Git, before the game reaches a pre-alpha stage.
