What's this doing here?
===============

Cricket Kamodon is a work-in-progress side-scrolling platform game starring an anthropomorphic cricket, programmed in QB64. As of January 5th, 2014, there is no stable build of this game yet. This is primarily used as a web backup, and for me to learn how to use Git, before the game reaches a pre-alpha stage.

I'm working on two separate builds, one for Linux, and one for Windows. I can also make a build for Mac OS X users as well, and I'll look into that, once I can get the game to a pre-alpha, or even an alpha, state.
