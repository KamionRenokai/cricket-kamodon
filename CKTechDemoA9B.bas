' This is the multi-platform build, forked from the original pseudo-Windows
' build of CK Tech Demo version 0.1.3, after I moved the source code over to
' QB64 from QuickBASIC (PDS) 7.1, and re-instated Aaron Severn's side-
' scrolling engine, and DarkDread's fade-in/out code. I did make a few tweaks,
' though, mainly borrowing bits and pieces of code from the engine I was
' originally going to build for the DOS version (and still might, if I decide
' to pick that project back up). But this one definitely runs without DOS,
' and should hopefully run in OSes other than Linux (like Windows XP, Vista,
' 7, 8 and Mac OS X) without too much trouble.
'
' Thanks to QB64, I can essentially port the code to C++ if I do it right,
' but it's now multi-platform (like I said above), so the only problem I
' would have, is compiling Cricket under any version of Mac OS X. Now, if
' someone would like to do that, so that Cricket can be ported to Mac OS,
' then by all means, feel free. This is open-source, after all.

'
' LIST OF GAME FIXES I'VE DONE SO FAR (FOR REFERENCE):
' alpha 0:  Ran out of space and memory using DATA and READ statements, and
'           would even get a "Module level code too large" message.
'     FIX:  Moved the hardware detection screen, FlameWare logo drawing
'           commands and the Cricket Kamodon logo (and probably menu, soon)
'           into SUBs, and moved the DATA commands into two files
'           (WLDXL1BG.KMD for background, and WLDXL1FG.KMD for foreground;
'           I'll follow the same method for the actual game (WLDAL1FG.KMD,
'           WLDBL4FG.KMD, etc.)
' alpha 1:  Background and foreground data file reader would get stuck at the
'           end of the first 22 lines in the data files (after 1024
'           characters), and would start redrawing the level from the
'           beginning, one row of sprites higher, about 3/4ths into the level.
'     FIX:  Reprogrammed the reader to grab every single line from the data
'           files, one after the other, and combine each line (1st and 23rd,
'           2nd and 24th, etc.), before reading each set of numbers between
'           the commas, and filling the foreground and background data arrays.
'           This also makes level design a bit more modder-friendly, since
'           this game will be open-source, after all. The current code
'           supports 110 rows of sprites.
' alpha 3:  Iminent problem of not having enough room to put the actual engine
'           code into the main module, because of the DATA statements toward
'           the end that draw each sprite.
'     FIX:  Will soon have to add another subroutine for the sprite reader,
'           which will theoretically let anyone add a lot more sprites, and
'           give each sprite up to 16 different frames of animation, through
'           files WLD?L?S0.KMD to WLD?L?SF.KMD. I figure this can make for
'           some incredibly realistic animation, if done right. This will move
'           the DATA statements that put the sprites into memory out of the
'           source code, and make room for the actual engine code.
' alpha 4:  Problem was averted with code conversion to QB64. This gets rid of
'           QuickBASIC's old "module level code too large" error, because now
'           I can put as much code in the main module as I want to, and I can
'           even use new commands, and background music/sound effects without
'           having to use a library. The only problem is, I feel like I'm
'           quickly running out of sprites I can use on one background plane.
'     FIX:  Increased the maximum number of different possible sprites one can
'           use per sprite plane to 1,000, from 100. If this isn't enough for
'           any potential modders, the level data files can be switched to
'           hexadecimal format instead, theoretically allowing up to 65,536
'           different possible sprites anyone can use on a map (no matter
'           which sprite plane they're put onto). I also added a second
'           background plane, so I can work on adding parallax scrolling.
' alpha 6:  Going to add in vertical scrolling, but I have to figure out a way
'           to implement it properly. The pixel drawing routine can't really
'           handle vertical and horizontal scrolling in its current state.
'     FIX:  Upgraded the drawing routine to be able to store multiple screens
'           (more than 22 rows), and made the background/foreground resource
'           files bigger, to accommodate this.
' alpha 7:  Having three sprite layers (BG1, BG2 and FG1) might make it hard
'           to do parallax scrolling in the future, especially since I'm using
'           BG1 for some of the background effects in Subcon 1.
'     FIX:  Created a fourth sprite layer, which will become the new BG1. The
'           original BG1 became BG2, the original BG2 became FG1, and the
'           original FG1 became FG2. This should make it easier to at least
'           do some sort of parallax scrolling with BG1.
' alpha 8:  The playfield drawing routine seems to be pretty fast... on both
'           a dual-core processor, and a first-generation high-end Core i7.
'           Testing the game both on a 2.2GHz Athlon 64, and a 1.6GHz(?)
'           Athlon XP make the drawing speed slow down to a crawl.
'     FIX:  Wrote a new routine, inspired by a new tutorial written by Garry
'           Ricketson of the QB64 forums (not copying code this time; I wrote
'           my own code, based on what he had wrote). It gives a huge speed
'           increase on the Athlon 64 and Athlon XP, even though the XP isn't
'           as fast as the 64. Still, that's an improvement.
